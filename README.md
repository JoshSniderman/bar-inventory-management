# Inventory Management: Using SQL and Jupyter Notebooks to Better Organize Liquor Inventory

A friend of mine runs a bar and has consistently struggled to manage his inventory and financial records. He asked me to help him better organize his inventory, which I have chosen to do using MySQL connector in Jupyter notebooks. These programs are set up so my friend, whom is quite computer illiterate, can simply open the corresponding program for whichever task he would like to do (viewing inventory records, update menu items, calculate cost ratios, etc.), simply hit "Run progam" at the top, and can insert his records as see fit.

This repository does not contain all programs written for the bar, just a few to simply demonstrate the mechanics of the tools used.

All programs were written between July - September of 2020.

**NOTE:** All programs are written to use data and passwords stored on the bar's personal server. For this reason, these codes will not run on an external system.
